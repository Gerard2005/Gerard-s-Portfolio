    <h1>Beauty Salon </h1>

    <p class="p2"> This is my FMP (Final Major Projecr) that I have done for Selby College and I have included evrything that I have learnt during the last year course 
        as well as the new things that I have taken from W-3schools and other helpful websites but of course I have created it to make it fit to this FMP and have meaten
        the cliets breif. I can also, add that for this project I have recieved Gold AKA Distinction overall. This site is also, responsive meaning that it can be viewed 
        on any device such as smart phones, tablets, laptops and many more. 
    </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

            <!--FlexContainer with text next to it-->

    <div class = "flexContainer-6">

        <div class="hair-salon-logo"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Logos/Main Logo Hair Dresser.png" width="35%">
    
    <p class="p11"> This is the logo that I have created using illusrator. This logo has an hover effect that makes the logo light up / be brighter and the reason 
        for this is because it shows that it works / takes the users some where on the page. Also, by having this hover effect it helps the users to see where there 
        courser is. I can add that by having the hover effect is giving a user ability to show that they are part of the website because the user has to do something 
        to make it work. </p>

        <div class = "flexContainer-7">

        <div class="hair-salon-nav"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Images/nav bar for hair dresser.png" width="35%">

            <p class="p12"> This is the navbar that I have created for the Hair-Salon project and as you can see all the information is in the nav bar and when users 
                click it, it takes them to the correct web page. The hover effect on htis website is grey ish and that shows that the navigation works and it helps the 
                users to see where there courser is pointing at. The section on prices without the hover effect is light goldish colour and when you hover over it the 
                box colour gets a solid gold colour and the text chnages to black to make it stand out for the users and the contrast is good making it easier for the 
                users to read it as well as see it. </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <div class = "flexContainer-8">

                <div class="hair-salon-prices"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Images/Hair Salon prices.png" width="35%">
        
                    <p class="p13"> This is the best part of my website and the reason for this is because it's a pop up that works on everypage that I have created. 
                        I can add that these are legit prices from the Selby Hair Salon but htere were too many things that the Selby College does therefore I have 
                        written at the end to be contined. The fonts have worked as you can see as it matches the headings and there is an close button as well for 
                        the users to click of it. This pop up has a very nice / good animation as well. I can say that I some issues with but at the end I have 
                        managed to make it work and I'm really happy with it.</p>

                            <p class="p14"> This is a wave that I have created using a website called "https://haikei.app/generators/" and I have made it suitable for this 
                                website by having the same colour as the colour scheme to match and I can add that it fades away to the white background making it look 
                            profesional as well as making it suit the clients brief and the waves are all across the pages to make the pages to have repetition. </p>

                        <p class="p15"> This is an image slidershow that I have done using HTML and CSS. The text chnages as well as the images as it gives some information
                        about each part that the Selby Colleges hair salon does. The images are full page and it's in white font due to making it easier for the customers / web 
                        users to read as well as see. The text has some shadowing to make it stand out making it a 3D effect.</p>

                            it's a good course to do. The button has the same hover effect to show repetition as well as to show it's clickable. The button's
                            hover effect is a solid gold colour and the button link takes you to the  Selby Colleges website to find out more infomration about 
                            the hair salon course and on that website you can apply to that course.</p>

                        <p class="p17"> This is information about the Selby Colleges are Salon such as opening and clsoing times. I have also included 
                            days as every day there is different hair style happening. I have also, alligned it centre like most of my website and the reason 
                            for this is because it helps the users to read it a lot easier and see the text as I have left enough space to make the users see
                            the different sections as well as placing the headers. There are 4 headings like this on the index page and the headings are closing / opening times, 
                            Beauty, HairDressing and Barbering.  </p>

                                   <p class="p18"> These are the cards that I have created using HTML and CSS and the reason I have added them is because it tells the users what else
                                    the Selby Colleges hair-Salon does. I got these images from a different website however I have chnaged the colour and the images a bit and the reason 
                                  for that is that it would'nt be a copy right. There is a hover effect on the button taht it shows the users that is clickable and it takes the users to 
                                the book now page for customers to book in if they would like to have a treatment on them. The text may not be readable due to being an image </p>

                                        that it was suitbale for this website. After you have filled it in there will be a text saying "thank you for filling it in" and then a phone number will be provided
                                      to call up for any more request / ask for addional information. </p>

                                              is because the students from Selby College hair-salon could represent them self's. I have also, created a sort of a 3D design and I did that by making 
                                            the middle tucan bigger compared to the left and the right clothing. Also, it makes it eye catching due to the size of them as on the website they are quite 
                                          big and there are prices of the clothing as well as sizes. When you go on mobile view they stack underneath each other and they don't break etc they have a perfect
                                        distance between them meaing that the viewers of the website can see the clothinhg clearly.  </p>
