    <h1> Posters Project </h1>

    <p class="p2"> This is the Project 1 that I have done last year and for this project I have been asked to created posters for Graphic Design, Web Design and Back-End Developemnt. I have created 
      these posters by using illustator and I'm proud of this project because it was my first time using illustator.  
    </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

            <!--FlexContainer with text next to it-->

    <div class = "flexContainer-23">

        <div class="poster-graphic"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Images/graphic design poster.png" width="35%">
    
    <p class="p29"> This is the first poster that I have created using illustator. As you can see this poster was created for Graphic Designer and i have included different font's. I have 
      played about with colour as well. I have also, included different effects and the reason for that is to make some sections of the poster to stand out more than other items. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <br>

    <div class = "flexContainer-23">

      <div class="poster-graphic"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Images/web-designer-poster.png" width="35%">
  
  <p class="p30"> This is the second poster that I have created using illusttator and as you can see I have improved because I have added back-ground image and moved the shapes to front as well as adding some strokes
    to give that 3D effect. There are few improvments that I could do to make it a lot better such as making the lines straight on the traingle shape etc but except from that I like the way it looks like because that 
    was my orignial idea that I have came up with. On this poster I have created my own logo as well and played about with colours I know it doesnt match because I made it stand out as well as unique.
  </p>

    <div class = "flexContainer-23">

      <div class="poster-graphic"> <img src = "Salon-Images/Images/Back-End-Developer.png" width="35%">
  
  <p class="p31"> This is the third poster that I have created using illusttator and as you can see I have added some glow effects to make it stand out as well as be eye-catchy for the audience that will see this poster. 
    I have added some softwares that a back-end developers are using as well as sallary and many things like that. I got the images from google. Also, while doing this poster I were doing research as well and the reason
    for this is because I wanted to find out to do effects to make it better then my last ones to show that I'm improving.</p>
